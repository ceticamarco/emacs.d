** Features
Tiny Emacs configuration(~100LOC) for Python, Haskell, web(HTML,CSS,JS/TS) development and document editing using Org mode. This configuration
aims to reproduce the Visual Studio Code experience with as few external packages as possible. Only the following packages will be installed:
- [[https://github.com/Alexander-Miller/treemacs][treemacs]];  
- [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode][LSP mode]];  
- [[https://protesilaos.com/emacs/modus-themes][modus-theme]];  
- [[https://magit.vc/][Magit]].

By default this configuration disables the /status bar/ and the /scroll bar/ in order to provide a minimal and
clean interface. 
Furthermore, it also splits /customization settings/ (i.e., settings made within the editor) in a separate file 
located at =~/emacs.d/custom.el=.

I've added LSP clients for Python, Haskell and for web development(HTML/CSS/JS/TS). 
If you want to add support for additional languages, you will need to add new /lsp-*/ packages by yourself. 
Be sure to also install the language server for each language you intend to use.

Since I also use Emacs as a "/task planner/", I've added the following lines to automatically load my personal agenda 
into ~org-agenda~.
My Org agendas are mirrored in a Dropbox folder, allowing me to access them directly from my phone using a mobile Org front-end.
#+begin_src lisp :eval no
  (require 'org)
  (define-key global-map (kbd "C-c c l") 'org-store-link)
  (define-key global-map (kbd "C-c c a") 'org-agenda)
  (setq org-log-done t)
  (setq org-agenda-files (list "~/Dropbox/agenda/scheduler.org"))
#+end_src

*NOTE*: I have tested this configuration with the latest Emacs version on macOS. The configuration file is updated and improved on a regular base and should work in any platformed supported by
Emacs with minimal tweaking.

** Prerequisites
Before installing the dotfiles, you will need to install the following dependencies:
- [[https://github.com/microsoft/pyright][pyright]];
- [[https://www.haskell.org/ghcup][GHCup]];
- [[https://nodejs.org/en][NodeJS]](as well as ~npm~);
- [[https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads][JetBrains Mono Nerd Font]].

** Installation
To Install this configuration copy the ~init.el~ as well as the ~custom.el~ files into the =~/.emacs.d= directory:
#+begin_src sh :eval no
  $> mkdir -pv ~/.emacs.d
  $> cp -Rv {init,custom}.el ~/.emacs.d
#+end_src

After that, open up Emacs and wait until it finishes to download, install and compile all the external packages. During the installation you may see
some warning messages on a new buffer, you can safely ignore them. You will not be bothered after the set up process will be completed.

** LSP: HTML/CSS/JS
Language servers for web development can be installed directly within Emacs. To do that, issue the following commands:

#+begin_src txt :eval no
  M-x lsp-install-server <RET> html-ls
  M-x lsp-install-server <RET> css-ls
  M-x lsp-install-server <RET> jsts-ls
#+end_src

** Keyboard shortcuts
You can also use the following shortcuts to quickly insert boilerplate code, document templates and text snippets inside your document:

| Shortcut  | Meaning                                                     |
|-----------+-------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~C-c c s~ | Include a /codeblock snippet/ with dynamic language loading |
| ~C-c c d~ | Close *ALL* buffers                                         |
| ~C-c c t~ | Toggle Treemacs                                             |
